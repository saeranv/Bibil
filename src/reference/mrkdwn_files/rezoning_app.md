###117-127 BROADWAY AVENUE
ref: http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2016/te/bgrd/backgroundfile-87101.pdf

####TYPE
- two 34-35 storey res towers (105 m tall)
- 5-7 storey podium (15 m)
- 16 storey base building = 45 m tall building

####DECISION HISTORY
- staff has issue with: height, floorplate size, s(t)epbacks, massing
- must adhere to TBG, and MiF

####OFFICIAL PLANE NOTES
- whole lot of stuff about built form
- 3.2.1 - finally we are getting to housing
- address the need to preserve and increase city's supply of rental and affordable housing
- policies in section 3.2.1 of Official Plan provide new development > 6/7, should replace same number
- tenant relocation/assistance plan required
#### SECONDARY PLAN
- more stuff about built form

####REASONS FOR APPLICATION
- because height and density goes above zoning by-law


####CITY STAFF CONCERNS
- compliacne with TBDG
- scale of development, 16 storey link building is to large
- somethinge about stepbacks
- not enough open space, parkland
- concentration of residential rental units: 905 additional rental units requires further analysis and justification ???!!!


###22 BALLIOL ST
http://www.toronto.ca/legdocs/mmis/2016/te/bgrd/backgroundfile-92308.pdf

####TYPE
- 38 storey mixed-use (retail - residential) rental building
= ballpark est: 38 * 750 = 30k m2 == 30000/100 = 300 res units
- 120m tall tower
- 3 storey base = 9m
- 430 residential units, 27k GFA

####STAFF CONCERNS
- compliance with TBG: floorplate is 800m2 not 750m2
- too big, city staff wants to determine if it is "contextually appropriate"
- height of development: would be tallest building in area, no "contextual/policy bsis for height" staff recommend it be lowered
- possible provision of community infrastructure
- shaodwing on the jr public school
- this whole "contextual" argument is weak on performance grounds
